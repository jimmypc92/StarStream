## StarStream

StarStream is a command line tool that can record Twitch streams. StarStream can convert the recorded videos to MP4 files if ffmpeg is available and specified in the configuration.
The eventual goal is to be able to have multiple commands available including the ability to automatically trigger recordings based on viewer count.
